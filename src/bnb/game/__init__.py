"""The game: its rules, state, physics, modes and perception, used through `bnb.game.api`.

VERSION rises whenever a change alters what the game computes (a rule, a constant, the
order of a sum that changes its rounding), so policy files and ratings say which game they
were made in. A refactor that computes the same numbers keeps it.
