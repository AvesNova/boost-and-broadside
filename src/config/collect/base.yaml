# Base configuration for collect commands
# This file extends the base configuration with data collection-specific defaults

# Inherits all defaults from base.yaml
defaults:
  - base
  - _self_

# Data collection-specific configuration
# Note: The data_collection section is already defined in base.yaml, so we don't need to redefine it here
