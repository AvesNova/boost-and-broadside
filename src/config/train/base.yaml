# Base configuration for train commands
# This file should NOT be used directly - use bc.yaml, rl.yaml, or full.yaml instead
# This file is just to establish the train/ directory structure

# No defaults to avoid circular references
# Each specific training config (bc, rl, full) should inherit from ../base directly
